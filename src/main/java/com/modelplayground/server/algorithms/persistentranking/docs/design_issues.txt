1. Overriding functions in Rank for comparing different Subtypes of Rank eg: LexoRank vs IntegeRank
2. Enforcing consistent use of a single rank type. for eg : something like LexoEntity
    otherwise we need to add rank in every entity as entity.setRank(new LexoRank()) but it may also be entity.setRank(new IntegerRank())
